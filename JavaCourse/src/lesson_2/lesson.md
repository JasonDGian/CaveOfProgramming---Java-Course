## Lesson 2 - Using variables.
What I've learnt this lesson. 

**Refactoring.**
- Renaming elements in our IDE or programs is called Refactor.
- Refactoring is much better than renaming things manually since it can automatically update references.
- Projects, packages, classes and even variables can be refactored among other things.

**Variables.**
- Variables can be declared and then initialized or initialized in one single statement.
- Variables have 'types' and each type has a different use case.

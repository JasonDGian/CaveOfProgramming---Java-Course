# Lessons summary

## Lesson 1 - My first program "Hello World!"
What'ive learned this lesson.
- The Java classes and packages have specific naming rules. 
- We must create an inicial package within which we place the program class.

## Lesson 2 - Using variables.
What I've learnt this lesson. 

**Refactoring.**
- Renaming elements in our IDE or programs is called Refactor.
- Refactoring is much better than renaming things manually since it can automatically update references.
- Projects, packages, classes and even variables can be refactored among other things.

**Variables.**
- Variables can be declared and then initialized or initialized in one single statement.
- Variables have 'types' and each type has a different use case.

## Lesson 3 - Shortcuts, indentation & concatenation.

- **CTRL + Space** shortcut.
By typing reduced versions of known elements we can quickly generate the complete statement or instruction.
For instance typing main and hitting the generation shortcut we can generate the application main entry point or by typing sysout generate a System Print instruction.

- Readability.
Indentation is important for code reading.

- Basics about concatenation.
We can concatenate variables of different types and use them within methods or store them in a new variable.

# Lessons Summary

## Lesson 1 - My First Program: "Hello World!"
### Key Takeaways
- Java classes and packages have specific naming rules.
- An initial package must be created within which the program class is placed.

## Lesson 2 - Using Variables
### Key Takeaways

**Refactoring**
- Renaming elements in an IDE or programs is called refactoring.
- Refactoring is superior to manual renaming as it can automatically update references.
- Projects, packages, classes, and variables, among other things, can be refactored.

**Variables**
- Variables can be declared and then initialized, or initialized in a single statement.
- Variables have 'types,' each with a different use case.

## Lesson 3 - Shortcuts, Indentation & Concatenation
### Key Takeaways

**CTRL + Space Shortcut**
- By typing abbreviated versions of known elements, we can quickly generate the complete statement or instruction.
- For instance, typing "main" and hitting the generation shortcut can generate the application's main entry point, or typing "sysout" can generate a System.out.print instruction.

**Readability**
- Indentation is important for code readability.

**Basics of Concatenation**
- We can concatenate variables of different types and use them within methods or store them in a new variable.

## Lesson 4 - Loops: 'While'
### Key Takeaways
- Boolean variable values can be determined by an analysis like "X < Y" or "Z = Z".
- Loop conditions, blocks, and types.

## Lesson 5 - Loops: 'For'
### Key Takeaways
- Code formatting shortcut (CTRL + Shift + F).
- Loop conditions, blocks, and types.
- Printf is a method to print formatted strings.

## Lesson 6 - Conditional Statements: 'if'
### Key Takeaways
- Difference between equality tests and assignments.
- Condition testing and code blocks.
- Execution order and hierarchy of conditional statement clauses.
- Manually breaking out of loops.

## Lesson 7 - User Input
### Key Takeaways
- Scanner object.
- Auto-import shortcut.
- Introduction to exceptions.

## Lesson 8 - Loops: 'Do While'
### Key Takeaways
- Disabling code comments.
- Difference between while and do-while loops.
- Variable scopes.

## Lesson 9 - Switch Case
### Key Takeaways
- Switch limitations to Strings and Ints.
- Default case in switch statements.

## Lesson 10 - Arrays
### Key Takeaways
- Memory allocation for variable values.
- "Off by one" problem -> Index 0 counting.
- OutOfBounds error.
- Array iteration and the 'length' property.

## Lesson 11 - String Arrays
### Key Takeaways
- Declaration and initialization in single sentence.
- Values accessing methods.
- New iteration method with a _for each_ loop.
- Difference between primitive and non-primitive types.
- Non-primitive types default null property.

## Lesson 12 - Multidimensional Arrays
### Key Takeaways
- Declaration and initialization of multidimensional arrays.
- Access to values.
- Iteration with for loops and counter variables.
- Regular and irregular multidimensional arrays.

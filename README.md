# Cave Of Programming Java Course.

### Welcome to my repository! 
My name is David Jason, and I'm currently learning **Java** among other things programming related.

<hr>

In this repository, I will track my progress in the Java course from [Cave of Programming](https://caveofprogramming.com/) taught by **Mr. John Purcell**. Additionally, I will practice my _Markdown_ skills and documentation techniques here. After each lesson, I will synthesize and summarize the concepts learned and practiced, then document them in a _Markdown_ (.md) file. During this course, I will also hone my skills in Git and GitHub, using both _Arch Linux_ and _Windows 11 Pro_. I am currently learning the _Eclipse IDE_, and this is the software I will be using to write my programs.

Thank you for visiting my repository! I hope you find my learning journey and documentation useful. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. Happy coding, and best of luck with your own projects and learning adventures!
